        Bio: Edwin Makhanu, a self-taught software developer with a passion for
        cutting-edge technologies, presents his fully designed application that
        seamlessly integrates Django REST Framework and React.js to create a
        powerful and user-friendly experience. With two years of experience
        under his belt, Edwin has embarked on a challenging journey over the
        past three months to bring this exceptional application to life. The
        backend of this remarkable creation is built upon Django REST Framework,
        a robust and efficient toolkit for building Web APIs. Edwin skillfully
        utilized its features and functionalities to develop a secure and
        scalable backend architecture. One of the highlights of this application
        is the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication,
        ensuring a reliable and seamless login experience for users. On the
        frontend, Edwin leveraged the power of React.js, a popular JavaScript
        library known for its efficient rendering and reusable component-based
        approach. By utilizing React.js, he crafted an intuitive and dynamic
        user interface that provides a smooth and engaging user experience.
        Users can effortlessly log in and upload images, showcasing the
        application's initial functionalities. As Edwin envisions taking this
        application to the next level, he plans to incorporate follow buttons
        and create a social media-like atmosphere. By introducing these
        features, he aims to provide users with a captivating and interactive
        experience, akin to popular social media platforms. Edwin's passion for
        exploring new technologies and pushing boundaries drives him to create
        innovative solutions. The journey of developing this application has not
        been without challenges. Edwin has encountered and triumphed over
        numerous bugs, some of which have posed significant obstacles, leading
        to delays of up to three days. However, his unwavering passion and
        determination have always prevailed, propelling him forward and enabling
        him to overcome any obstacles encountered along the way. Edwin Makhanu
        is grateful for the opportunity to share his application with you. He
        looks forward to collaborating with qualified professionals, further
        expanding his skill set, and exploring new avenues within the realm of
        technology. Edwin's drive and commitment to innovation make him an ideal
        candidate for future collaborations and exciting projects. Thank you for
